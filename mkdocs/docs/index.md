I am an experienced DevOps Architect with proficiency with cloud computing platforms such as AWS and GCP, containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes, version control strategies, build tools like Gradle, Maven and Make, and infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform and Ansible. I have a comprehensive experience supporting companies to adopt the Culture, Processes, and Tools of Devops.

I have successfully led and implemented DevOps workstreams for high visibility projects from development to production, and have developed CI/CD pipelines for microservices and QA tests. Additionally, I am certified in various cloud and DevOps technologies.
